<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: var(--text-main); line-height: 1.8;">
TriGrove Consulting operates a curated network of independent advisors who are engaged on a per-engagement basis. Advisors are not employees of TriGrove Consulting. Each advisor maintains their own independent practice and is responsible for their own professional conduct, insurance, and compliance requirements.

<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: var(--text-main); line-height: 1.8;">
All consulting engagements are subject to written agreements that define scope, deliverables, timing, and compensation. TriGrove Consulting facilitates advisor matching and engagement management but does not guarantee specific outcomes or results.
